    <p class="body1">
        <b>Rishik</b> and <b>Devam</b>, alumni of <i>SVKM's Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic and College of Engineering</i>, 
        always dreamt of transforming the chemical industry with sustainability at its core.
        <p class="body1"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Rishik</strong>, with his <em>perpetually ink-stained fingers</em> and a mind buzzing with molecular formulas, and <u>Devam</u>, whose sharp business acumen was as precise as a titration, were an unlikely pair, yet the heart and soul of Swaastik Chemical Factory. 
        Rishik, the <code>alchemist</code> of the duo, dreamt of synthesizing novel compounds that could revolutionize everything from <blockquote>fertilizers to pharmaceuticals</blockquote>, while Devam, ever pragmatic, ensured that those dreams translated into profitable, sustainable ventures.
         They navigated the labyrinthine world of chemical regulations and market demands with a shared, quiet determination, their partnership a delicate balance of explosive creativity and grounded strategy, much like the very reactions they engineered within their gleaming, stainless steel vats.

        Determined to bridge this gap, they founded <b>Swastik Chemical Factory</b>‚Äîa venture dedicated to producing
